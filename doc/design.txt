should there be relations between tags?
Interesting question. There should be.
A tag may imply another tag (sub tag).
For instance: a tag of "orange" is a sub tag of "fruit".
	This means that if I search for fruit I will also find
	all tagged as orange.
	"orange" may also be "somethingyellow"
	So any tag may be a subtag of any number of tags.
Tagger should know how to read realtionships between tags and import them
into the database.
